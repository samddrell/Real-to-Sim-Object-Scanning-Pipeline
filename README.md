# Real-to-Sim-Object-Scanning-Pipeline

Steps:
1. Take 50+ photos of object
    - Need to be similarly framed with object at center of photo
    - simple background
    - On non-reflective surface that's clear of clutter
    - Circle the object from a variety of heights and angles. Each image should have large overlap.
    - Make sure the images are jpg's or png's (jpgs process faster due to compression)
    - Dont crop - this will happen at a later stage
